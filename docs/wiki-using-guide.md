## Editing pages on Github

You should use reST to edit .rst file, and Pandoc Markdown to edit .md file.

These are some learning resources:

- [How to use Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by John Gruber

When you edit pages on Github, you can click "Preview changes" to view the results. You can check the building processing [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nebdocs/builds/).
