# How to Contribute
> *Your contribution matters!*

> Nebulas aims for a continuously improving ecosystem, which means we need everyone's efforts from community. We here call for your contribution. It can be not only programming, bug reporting and tranlating, but also can be talking with others or answering others' questions with your favourite IM tools or email.

## 1. Code & Documentation
### 1.1. Mainnet Development
<!--Nebulas mainnet development is the most important and challenging portion of Nebulas technical development. -->
Besides programming, mainnet development also needs efforts to tackle the most
chanllenging problems in the whole blockchain industry. For example, we need
design manipulation-resistant mechanisms for blockchain, formally verify
new consensus algorithm, improve security of Nebulas mainnet, apply new
crypto algorithm to Nebulas, and etc..

We are so excited to devote ourselves to blockchain and seeing how blockchain
makes people's life better. And we want to share this exciting experience to
the whole community. Thus, we call for each developers!

### 1.2. Bug Reporting
We always value bug reporting!

If you find a bug, please report it to the Nebulas community. Bugs may be found on Nebulas testnet, mainnet, nebPay, neb.js, web wallet, as well as other tools and documentation. We will follow OWASP Risk Assessment System to calculate the corresponding bounty/reward based on the risk degree of the bug.

<!--Every time we launch a new function, we will first deploy it on our testnet. Currently, we have launched our first new function on the Nebulas testnet and everyone is welcome to try it, report any found bugs and receive the corresponding reward. The first of many new functions in public beta on the testnet is the inter-contract function.-->
If you have suggestions on how to fix bugs or help us make improvements, please do not hesitate to let us know. You can also participate in the development and directly protect the on chain assets. Together let’s make Nebulas even more safe, secure and robust.
